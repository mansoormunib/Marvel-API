For using Marvel API on front end client I added code pen domain in marvel developer account.

On development version I used encrypted keys both public and private to call api. Private key should only be used on server side, that's why I removed it when published on codepen. This task is done using npm, gulp task runner, SASS, jQuery.


To start development project

Enter your PRIV_KEY in js/scripts.js file then add your domain in marvel.

run npm install

gulp sass:watch
